# Milestone 6: Collectable cycle: C allocates GC-managed memory

[ previous: [m5](../m5/); next: [m7](../m7/) ]

## Overview

This milestone represents a minimal solution to the cycle problem, but
from C instead of from raw WebAssembly.  Instead of using classes as
data abstractions, the C here will use the raw allocation and accessor
imports defined in [milestone 4](../m4).

## Interesting files

The difference from [m4](../m4) is that instead of
[`test.wat`](../m4/test.wat), we have [`test.c`](./test.c).

## Results

No results yet; this milestone is in progress.
