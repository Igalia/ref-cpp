# Milestone 6: Collectable cycle: C allocates GC-managed memory

## Overview

This milestone represents a minimal solution to the cycle problem, but
from C instead of from raw WebAssembly.  Instead of using classes as
data abstractions, the C here will use the raw allocation and accessor
imports defined in [milestone 4](../m4).

## Results

No results yet; this milestone is in progress.
