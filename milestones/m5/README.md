# Milestone 5: C manages side table of JavaScript objects

## Overview

Having shown where we're going and that milestone 4 solves the cycle
problem, we need to return to the C++-to-WebAssembly problem: we are
lacking a way to represent `externref` values in C++, and support in the
LLVM compiler.  As a first step in this direction, we're going to
translate milestone 3's test program back to an extended version of C
that has rudimentary support for reference types.

## Results

No results yet; this milestone is in progress.
